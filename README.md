# APP Base

This is the base code to build a basic API server using Jersey. This repo 
contains a server and a client. 

The project uses Gradle to manage library dependencies. 

## Server

The sever code is at `/src/main/java/com/app/server` and implements a single resource called `Driver`

## Client

A client to test the server is at `/src/main/java/com/app/client/` called Client.java which can
be run as a class. 

Note that all code in this repository is rudimentary and provide you a starting point for 
the class material.

## Compatibility

* JDK 1.8
* Tomcat 8.5 or 9
